# SQL Project - Retail Store Dataset

This repository documents my SQL practice journey using a Retail Store dataset.

Instead of just writing random queries, I focused on solving business problems that companies face in sales, customers, and product management. Each project demonstrates how I approach a problem, structure the query, and extract insights.

Through these projects, I practiced:

* Data modeling (creating tables for Customers, Products, Orders, OrderDetails)

* Joins (INNER, LEFT)

* Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

* Grouping & filtering with GROUP BY, HAVING

* Date/time analysis (YEAR(), DATE_FORMAT())

* Business insights (sales trends, repeat customers, inventory risk)
